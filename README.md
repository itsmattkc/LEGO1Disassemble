# LEGO1 Disassemble

This is a machine-generated compilable disassembly of LEGO1.DLL from LEGO Island. The x86 assembly is wrapped up in C++ functions and a Visual Studio solution and can be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ to produce a drop-in replacement DLL for LEGO Island.

This code has not been documented or made readable in any way, it is mainly to aid the production of a full C++ decompilation of LEGO1.DLL in the near future. However, for all intents and purposes it can be modified, reassembled, and used in-game.

This was primarily produced by a machine and initially contained some errors that were manually corrected. It is now considered fully functional, but if there are any lingering errors causing issues in gameplay, please report them on the "Issues" tab.

Releases are on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/itsmattkc/lego1disassemble/build/artifacts).
